# PROJECT_MEMORY — running context for agents

**Who reads this:** Primarily Cursor agents between sessions. Keep it **short and current**; trim or archive stale bullets rather than appending forever.

**Authority (when documents disagree):** `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` defines purpose and taste. **`docs/design-direction.md`** governs visual identity and cosmetics-track work. **Dagh’s latest message in chat wins** on scope and direction. This file records **logistics, recent work, and near-term intent** — not a second brief. Rituals and agent rules: **`AGENTS.md`**.

---

## Current focus

- **Design / cosmetics track:** **Phase A hub shell + Status Phase B v1.2 shipped in repo** (May 2026) — `status.php` 4-col room grid, league month toggle, shared `.k2-panel-heading`, softer `--k2-text-primary` (`#d0d7de`). Spec: `docs/STATUS_PAGE_DATA.md`. **Next:** WinSCP to staging; Steve for prod DB read + joshua redirect; realm switcher when Amiga exists.

- **Charts:** **six-colour palette signed** (May 2026) — canonical tokens `pitch` / `chrome` / `holo` / `amber` / `teal` / `magenta` in `theme.css` + `chart-theme.js`; Activity on `server1.php`; profile uses pitch/chrome or `profileCompare*` helpers. No legacy green/blue/coral/purple names.

- **DB performance (May 2026):** Profile load fixed mainly via **`idx_ratedresults_idA` / `idx_ratedresults_idB`** — local + staging; **production still pending** (Steve when agreed). Heavy profiles ~**8s → ~1s** locally. **Status page local + staging DB fixed** via `idx_ratedresults_date`, `idx_resulttable_live_status`, and `player_monthly_league`; local HTTP ~8.5s → ~0.28s, staging SQL verified by Steve (2,674 monthly rows / 149,740 appearances). **`server1.php` shell is fast locally** (~40–120ms HTML); remaining Activity cost is async chart APIs (~2.8s concurrent / ~7s sequential), mainly established-player and active-player aggregates.

- **Profile feast (shipped):** production **`individual1.php`** only — **`docs/player-profile-feast.md`**. Further work = gradual copy/UX, not mock lab (`docs/archive/`).

- **Product tone:** ladder stays **truthful and data-rich**; surface **inclusive, playful, welcoming**. Profile above-the-fold = participation first; deep analytics lower (“matchup lab”).

- **Fun stats block (planned, not built):** trophy-cabinet highlights from `playertable` + monthly `ratedresults` SQL — **no longest-game** stat.

- **Operational loop:** edit locally/Git → **WinSCP** sync `site/public_html/` → staging `public_html/`; hard refresh after assets. **SSH:** permission denied for Dagh (May 2026) — Steve runs one-offs when sent.

- **Ladder replay (Python):** P0–P2 done — local `ko2unity_db` + staging `kooldb` replay; **`docs/STAGING_REPLAY.md`**, **`scripts/ladder/README.md`**. Deferred P3–P5: **`docs/ladder-engine-plan.md`**. **Prod live ratings stay C++.**

- **`ratedresults` only** for ladder/replay (~74.9k rated rows). **`resulttable`** is wider match log — external JSON on `GameID` can differ slightly; expected.

- **Local dev:** **`docs/LOCAL_DEV.md`** — `http://ratingskickoff.test`, DB `ko2unity_db`, dump `data/dumps/`, replay `scripts/run_local_replay.ps1`.

- **Change style:** small, reversible slices.

## Next (prioritised intent)

1. **Deploy cosmetics slice** — WinSCP sync `site/public_html/` → staging; hard refresh hub, ranked, server, **status** pages.
2. **Status on prod data** — Steve: prod DB read for live panels; joshua redirect when agreed (`docs/STATUS_PAGE_DATA.md`).
3. **Launch polish** — realm switcher when Amiga exists.
4. **Profile gradual improvements** — `docs/player-profile-feast.md`; archived planning in `docs/archive/`.
5. **Fun stats block (v1)** — trophy cabinet from `playertable` + monthly SQL; exclude longest game.
6. **Prod coordination** — when stored truth changes: `docs/prod-coordination.md`, registers, `schema/migrations/`.
7. **Optional** — local `ko2unitydb_config.php` template from Steve (gitignored).

## Recent log

*(Newest first. Keep this to the latest high-signal handoff rows; older phase detail lives in feature docs / git.)*

| When | What |
|------|------|
| 2026-05 | **Post-game snippet workflow retired** — behavior only in `docs/website-data-contract.md`; local/staging = SCH + REP; deleted `cpp-snippets/` PG-005–013; kept `docs/coordination/records-post-game-exception.md` (ex-HoF PG-004). Agents must not cite PG-NNN as blocking work. `feature-log` uses **Prod live** not Post-game column. |
| 2026-05 | **Staging HoF record defects catalogued** — [`docs/staging-post-game-record-defects.md`](docs/staging-post-game-record-defects.md): Gianni streak dates, Fiery CS victims, Eternalstudent opp/vic, etc. (C++ post-game); golden checks extended; ops doc clarifies ladder replay vs website-derived rebuild. |
| 2026-05 | **Post-game replay contract** — Python replay now pins `SET time_zone = '+00:00'` at connection, so `generalstatstable` record dates are UTC-correct. `docs/website-data-contract.md` expanded with full `generalstatstable` semantics (tie policy: strict `>`, ratio leaders excluded, UTC rule, victim-count gates). Golden record checks added (`scripts/ladder/golden_record_checks.py`). PG-004 rewritten as explicit behavior-change handoff (DELETE ratio blocks, CHANGE `>=` to `>`, ADD UTC pin). Replay architecture section documents event engine as behavior authority, SQL rebuilds as parity helpers. Local replay rerun: all golden checks pass. |
| 2026-05 | **Derived-data contract refactor** — `docs/website-data-contract.md` is now the behavior authority for project-owned aggregate tables, rebuild rules, parity checks, and post-game requirements. `scripts/rebuild_website_derived_data_local.ps1` is the one-command local rebuild path; old period/monthly rebuild wrappers now point to it. `docs/stored-truth-expansion.md` and `docs/player-period-games.md` are redirects, while registers track status only. |
| 2026-05 | **UTC period-boundary fix** — `ratedresults.Date` is `timestamp`, so local Estonia MySQL sessions were rebuilding day buckets three hours ahead of UK/staging. Added `SET time_zone = '+00:00'` to PHP DB connections and rebuild scripts, reran local aggregate rebuilds, and verified daily stored rows now match UTC buckets (e.g. 2026-05-17=26, 2026-05-18=31). `api/server_matchup_breadth.php` now also uses the UTC pin and `server_period_matchups`. |
| 2026-05 | **Stored truth expansion** — Five new aggregate tables locally applied and rebuilt (SCH-008): `player_period_league` (38,944 rows), `player_milestones` (151 rows), `player_matchup_summary` (3,905 rows), `server_period_game_totals` (3,731 rows), `server_period_matchups` (63,283 rows). All parity-checked against `ratedresults` (74,870 games). Status league, Activity APIs, Profile opponent/calendar/feast APIs, and milestone charts now read stored truth. C++ snippets PG-009–013 drafted. Contract: `docs/website-data-contract.md`. |
| 2026-05 | **Daily active players chart + stored truth experiment** — `server1.php` now has an all-time "Daily active players · 30-day average" line chart reading new `server_daily_activity` table (SCH-007); local perf test shows stored path **~73x faster** than raw `ratedresults` computation (~21ms vs ~1542ms query); API supports `source=stored|raw`; post-game snippet PG-008 drafted. |
| 2026-05 | **Dev period activity date picker affordance** — the Daily panel date input now has a visible accent calendar button and a brightened native picker indicator, so users can open the calendar instead of typing a date. |
| 2026-05 | **Top activity eras chart shipped locally** — `server1.php` now has a "Top activity eras" multi-player line chart: each month shows the top 10 players by rated games, lines appear/disappear as players enter/leave the top 10, hover highlights one player and dims others; powered by new `api/server_top_activity_eras.php` reading `player_period_games` (L0, no new stored truth). |
| 2026-05 | **Realm header identity layout promoted** — shared `site_header.php` now uses the first lab direction: Online/Amiga beside the Kick Off 2 wordmark, with player search isolated on the right; strip variant remains lab-only for comparison. |
| 2026-05 | **Stored truth performance policy added** — agent instructions now say DB-backed features should actively consider indexes, aggregate tables, replay outputs, `playertable` fields, periodic jobs, and post-game C++ updates as normal options for hot stats/profile/achievement work, not burdens to avoid. |
| 2026-05 | **Ranked8 phone activity layout fix** — Calendar and All time activity tables now keep their intended two-column layout below tablet widths, with horizontal overflow only if a very narrow viewport needs it. |
| 2026-05 | **Period activity staged preview unblocked** — `dev-period-activity.php` now permits the staging host (`ratings.kickoff2.com`) while remaining host-guarded elsewhere; page copy now says dev/staging preview. |
| 2026-05 | **Status panel action-link alignment** — the active leaderboard `Leaderboards →` link now uses the same compact Status action styling as `Activity →` and `Games →`. |
| 2026-05 | **Activity Graph Roadmap shipped** — five new Activity features: 12-month daily heatmap (GitHub-style), participation depth stacked bars (1/2-4/5-9/10+ bands), play-texture small-multiples (goals/game, draw %, DD/100, CS/100), unique matchups per month, and a recent milestone digest card; all L0 read-time from `ratedresults`+`playertable`. |
| 2026-05 | **Double Digit Merchant charts** — Activity now has a read-time chart trio for first 10+ goal games: new merchants by year, cumulative merchants, and merchant rating distribution; data is derived from `ratedresults`, not stored on `playertable`. |
| 2026-05 | **Activity copy sharpened** — `server1.php` no longer says "server" in user-facing chart headings/status/aria copy; the past-month daily games chart now shows the same `Games` legend chip as the longer-horizon charts. |
| 2026-05 | **Tooltip microcopy audit** — redundant chart helper under the Activity daily chart removed; table/header tooltip copy now favors abbreviation definitions, formulas, and contextual rules while obvious labels fall back to the shared `Click to sort.` affordance; tint picker native hover titles are removed. |
| 2026-05 | **Chart semantics pass** — chart colors now follow a first-pass vocabulary: pitch = games/wins/profile subject, amber = goals, chrome = active players/projections/opponent focus, holo = cumulative history, magenta = milestones, teal = distributions; dense monthly bars stay borderless. |
| 2026-05 | **Activity recent daily chart** — `server1.php` now opens its chart stack with a past-month games-per-day bar chart from `api/server_games_by_day_recent.php`, including zero-game days. |
| 2026-05 | **Hub nav reordered** — top nav is now `Status · Activity · Games · Leaderboards · Hall of Fame`, frontloading life/evidence before competition and records. |
| 2026-05 | **Status leaderboard sorting** — Status active leaderboard now loads `k2-table.js` for sortable Rank/Player/Elo/Games columns with compact header help, autorank on resort, `past year` heading copy, and `Leaderboards →` destination meta. |
| 2026-05 | **Game table tooltips** — `server3.php` keeps all-column header popups and `game.php` mirrors them as non-sortable help; deep Elo explanation lives on `Fav ES` and visible `Adjustment`. |
| 2026-05 | **Activity summary completes legacy stats merge** — `server1.php` now folds the old Overall Server Stats table into a key sentence, four fact cards (goals/draws/DD/CS), and a quiet games/opponents line before charts. |
| 2026-05 | **Status arc → Activity landing** — Status rated-games arc links to `server1.php` with a discreet left-aligned action below the sentence; Activity opens with the all-time activity story before the historical charts. |
| 2026-05 | **Table spacing cleanup + Games detail path** — inline table `&nbsp;`/`text-align` hacks removed from ranked/player/server/game table families in favor of `theme.css` utilities; `server3.php` now shows 14 day buckets with fully sortable game tables (`GD`, `Elo Diff`, `Fav ES`, `Adjustment`), and Status recent games links to the full Games list via `Games →`. |
| 2026-05 | **Status league stack shipped locally** — `status.php` now stacks uncapped Daily, Weekly (Monday-start), Monthly, and Yearly league panels where the monthly league was; each has its own current/previous toggle, shared 3/1/0 table logic, MySQL `NOW()` server-clock boundaries, and live countdown/end meta. |
| 2026-05 | **Period activity + daily activity on staging** — `kooldb`: SCH-006/007 + REP-003 (week), REP-005, REP-006 backfills done May 2026; stored-truth PHP OK on staging; prod live C++ at cutover per contract. |
| 2026-05 | **Status online presence fix** — Online now uses nonzero `IsOnline` directly, without the `Display = 1` ladder/public-stats gate, and `status.php` sends no-cache headers so frozen lobby presence is not hidden by stale pages. |
| 2026-05 | **Status recent games simplified** — recent games on `status.php` now show player names and score only; rating adjustment deltas were removed from that compact lane. |
| 2026-05 | **Status column balance tweak** — `status.php` room grid now runs ticker/new players, online/logins, live/recent games, then a strengthened art/leaderboard lane, with the first column slightly widened. |
| 2026-05 | **Leaderboard filter docs cleanup** — stale open/todo references removed from hub/status docs; current Leaderboard filters are treated as shipped, not next-step experiments. |
| 2026-05 | **Persistent tint preference** — tint picker now stores `k2-accent-tune` in `localStorage`, migrates old session-only values, boots before first paint, and syncs across open tabs. |
| 2026-05 | **Status realm header lab** — `status-realm-lab.php` compares two mock shells on real Status content: A realm beside wordmark, B realm strip above hub nav; shared header remains unchanged. |
| 2026-05 | **Status performance staging DB done** — Steve ran SCH-005 + REP-004 on staging `kooldb`; indexes exist and `player_monthly_league` check passed (`SUM(played)` 149,740 = `ratedresults` × 2). Monthly row count differs from local (2,674 vs 2,679), which is OK; appearances are the invariant. |
| 2026-05 | **`elolist.css` cleanup** — legacy stylesheet removed from shared head; ranked table cloak now lives in `theme.css`; K2 table plan open-work item closed. |
| 2026-05 | **Hub nav preview scaffolding pruned** — removed `nav-preview.php`, `?k2_hub_nav`/session style overrides, and solid/soft CSS branches; segment nav is now the fixed contract. |
| 2026-05 | **Tint picker docs settled** — hidden-by-default behavior remains current; stale launch-decision wording pruned. |
| 2026-05 | **Chart helper tone audit** — stale chart/helper tone backlog pruned; current chart contract/copy already covers canonical colours, context, sample-size, and matchup framing. |
| 2026-05 | **K2 table plan cleanup** — stale open-work entries pruned; remaining follow-ups now reflect only active table work. |
| 2026-05 | **Status page performance fix** — local schema `004_status_performance_and_monthly_league.sql` adds `ratedresults.Date` + live `resulttable` indexes and `player_monthly_league`; Status monthly league now prefers the aggregate with raw SQL fallback. Loader ~6.6s → ~51ms; local HTTP ~8.5s → ~0.28s. |
| 2026-05 | **Current-truth docs prune** — MEMORY recent log trimmed; `design-direction.md`, `hub-ia-agreement.md`, and `k2-table-and-games-plan.md` now foreground current contracts/open work instead of phase diary history. |
| 2026-05 | **Replay/ops safety gates** — ladder replay now has explicit `--target local|staging`, refuses staging `kooldb` unless target is explicit, logs DB identity preflight, staging wrapper passes `--target staging`; local schema/index/period rebuild wrappers refuse non-local DBs without `-AllowNonLocal`. |
| 2026-05 | **Period activity staging DB done** — Steve ran `player_period_games` schema + rebuild on staging `kooldb`; expectation test passed; note MariaDB requires `COUNT(*)`, not `COUNT()`. |
| 2026-05 | **Legacy PHP safety pass** — added `includes/k2_safety.php`; `individual2a/b/c.php` now validate player `id`, use safe DB connect/query errors, and escape opponent links; `ranked1`–`ranked5`/`ranked7` use the same helper for DB connect/query errors and escaped player links. |
| 2026-05 | **Sortable header help tooltips** — `k2-table.js` now uses a styled shared tooltip for sortable headers, combining abbreviation/activity/player-table explanations with the “Click to sort.” hint, including server-side Games history sort links. |
| 2026-05 | **Realm switch flash fix** — header toggle initial paint now follows early `html[data-realm]` boot state, so Amiga no longer flashes Online during main-nav page loads. |
| 2026-05 | **Leaderboard/player table modernization** — `ranked1`–`ranked5`, `ranked7`, `ranked8`, and `individual2a/b/c` use opt-in `k2-table.js`; profile Games uses server-side Result/Opponent filters, URL sort links, 100-row slices, and shared row rendering. |
| 2026-05 | **Activity / Hall of Fame / Records polish** — `ranked8.php` period/all-time activity tables, `server2.php` two-panel Hall of Fame split, peak-period aggregate fallback, and natural-width table polish are in repo. |
| 2026-05 | **Games tab shared row renderer** — `game.php` and the Games tab share `includes/k2_rated_game_row.php`; current Games tab behavior is recorded in the newer table-spacing cleanup row above. |
| 2026-05 | **Status Phase B v1.2 in repo** — `status.php` has 4-col room grid, active leaderboard, monthly league toggle, recent logins/registrations/games; prod DB read + joshua redirect still open. |
| 2026-05 | **Profile feast shipped** — production `individual1.php` feast layout only; mock lab removed; further profile work should be gradual copy/UX. |
| 2026-05 | **Core migration/prod coordination set up** — `prod-coordination.md`, registers, schema migrations, staging replay docs, and C++ snippet handoff pattern exist; prod live ratings still C++. |
| 2026-05 | **Chart/theme foundation shipped** — six-ink chart palette, dark theme tokens, shared header/nav/wing tabs, and `status.php` hub landing are in repo. |

## Deferred / blocked

- GitHub branch protection — when collaborators land.
- **Amiga/offline** datasets — after dev migration workflow is routine.
- **Pretty URLs** (`/online/{id}`) — needs Steve (`.htaccess` / vhost).
