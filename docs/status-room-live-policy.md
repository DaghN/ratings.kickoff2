# Status room live — policy

**Status:** Shipped (Jul 2026). Spec for making `status.php` a **living lobby** — heartbeat polling, cascade refresh on rated game finish, client-side live-game clocks, and glow feedback.

**Authority:** Product + [`STATUS_PAGE_DATA.md`](STATUS_PAGE_DATA.md). Dagh's latest chat wins on scope. Visual glow defers to [`design-direction.md`](design-direction.md) accent tokens.

**For agents:** read this before adding Status live polling, pulse APIs, or lobby glow. Implementation slices: [`status-room-live-implementation-plan.md`](status-room-live-implementation-plan.md).

**Pointers:** [`status-period-competitions.md`](status-period-competitions.md) · [`status-room-live-sim-spec.md`](status-room-live-sim-spec.md) (**live environment simulation** — login, register, games; work harness) · [`k2-jukebox-popup.md`](k2-jukebox-popup.md) (glow reference) · [`k2-page-boot.js`](../site/public_html/js/k2-page-boot.js) (`k2OnPageReady`)

## Product intent

Status is the **“right now”** hub — who is online, what is playing, what just happened. Today the room is **server-rendered once** per full page load; only the Leagues meta countdown ticks client-side (30 s).

**Goal:** the whole room **comes alive** without reload:

- **1 s heartbeat** — cheap signal check; heavy work only when something changed.
- **Rated game finish** is the **master cascade** — recent games, rating table, league standings, arc totals update together.
- **Lobby ticks** — live scores, online presence, logins, registrations patch in place.
- **Live-game half clock** runs down **client-side** between heartbeats (smooth, no extra DB reads).
- **Glow feedback** — jukebox-speed **text ink** bloom on names, digits, and counts (no row/panel box glow).

**Not a separate live feed from Steve.** Same KOOL Unity MySQL family as today ([`STATUS_PAGE_DATA.md`](STATUS_PAGE_DATA.md) § Finding). Staging and local **dev** remain **snapshot stale** unless you run the **live environment sim** on work (below).

**Testing without prod:** [`status-room-live-sim-spec.md`](status-room-live-sim-spec.md) — do not wait for tonight's play to exercise pulse, cascade, and glow.

## Locked decisions

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| SRL-1 | **Polling, not push** — no WebSockets/SSE for v1. Game server already writes MySQL; web reads it. |
| SRL-2 | **One heartbeat endpoint** — `api/status_room_pulse.php` (name locked in plan). Client polls **every 1 s** while the page is loaded. **Do not** voluntarily pause on `document.hidden` (multi-monitor / tiled layouts). **Browser note:** background tabs may throttle timers; **catch-up poll** on `visibilitychange` / `pageshow` (bfcache) / `focus` so returning to Status reflects current DB immediately. |
| SRL-3 | **Server-side 1 s shared cache** on the pulse bundle — all viewers share one compute tick per second. |
| SRL-4 | **Two change kinds:** **lobby tick** (presence, live state) vs **rated finish cascade** (`last_rated_id` change). |
| SRL-5 | **`last_rated_id`** = `MAX(id) FROM ratedresults` — primary cascade trigger. When it changes, refresh cascade sections (below). |
| SRL-6 | **Between finishes:** no rating-table or league-standings work. Heading count reloads **with** the full rating table on cascade, not on its own. |
| SRL-7 | **League refresh:** **active period tab only** (Day / Week / Month / Year). No adjacent-tab prewarm in v1 — keep simple. |
| SRL-8 | **Both** Activity + Points league tables in cascade (same period key as active tab). Reuse existing league query/API helpers where possible. **Daily / Weekly games blocks** refresh with the same league pulse when that tab is active (`day_games` / `week_games_html` on the league section). |
| SRL-9 | **Live half clock (state machine):** § Half countdown math — **pending** until first decrease (or mid-half join); **running** = smooth uncapped 1 s tick on **client** clock; **held** after **6 s** with no decrease (pause). Re-anchor on decrease only when server is ahead of/equal to local. Injury time = later. |
| SRL-10 | **Glow — minimal set + cascade:** (1) **Online** — name when **`LastLogin` epoch increased** (warm bloom). (2) **Live** — new game **score digits** (0–0, white). (3) **Recent** — names (warm) + score digits (white). (4) **Goals** — scoring cell white bloom then digit reveal (SRL-11). (5) **Active LB** — **Elo** (warm). (6) **League Activity** — **Games** (warm). (7) **League Points** — **Pts** (warm). **2.6 s**. Scores / `.blue` = white; accent ink = warm. |
| SRL-11 | **Glow — live goal:** white bloom on scoring **cell**; **reveal new digit at ~2 s** into the 2.6 s bloom — old digit glows first, then count updates in place. Kickoff 0–0 glow unchanged (immediate). |
| SRL-12 | **Retired — cascade glow sequence:** no post-cascade glow choreography. Glow only from **SRL-10/11** lobby rules. |
| SRL-13 | **First paint stays SSR** — `status.php` + `k2_status_load_room()` unchanged for no-JS and fast paint; heartbeat **enhances**. |
| SRL-14 | **Revision / fingerprint** — when no signals changed, API returns `{ changed: false, revision, server_now_epoch, live_clocks }` (tiny body; **`live_clocks` always** for SRL-9). |
| SRL-15 | **Period rollover:** heartbeat includes `period_keys` (day/week/month/year). Key change → league reload — **no meta glow**. |
| SRL-16 | **Sortable rating table:** after cascade DOM replace, call **`k2TableRefreshSortableBody(table)`** — preserves user sort when `_k2SortUserChosen`; else default Elo desc + autorank refresh |
| SRL-17 | **Live sim hook:** `api/status_room_pulse.php` may call `k2_status_room_sim_tick_if_due()` when [`k2_status_room_sim_is_allowed()`](../../site/public_html/includes/status_room_live_sim.php) — **work host + `ko2unity_work` only**; never prod/staging. Sim UI at `/status-room-live-sim.php`, not on `status.php`. |

---

## Change model

**Writer-agnostic:** Pulse reads **current DB state** only. It does not know whether a row changed from prod post-game, manual ops, or the work-host live sim — only that signals differ from what the client last reported. **`changed: false`** when and only when every tracked signal in the client’s GET params matches a **fresh** server read (not a revision hash alone). Live sim may hook the pulse endpoint to advance test ticks (SRL-17); that hook is guarded inside the sim module and does not alter pulse signal rules.

### Lobby tick (frequent, small patches)

| Signal | Source | Client action |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| `live_fp` | Hash of live `resulttable` rows (`game_id`, scores, `GamePeriod`) — **not** `half_countdown`; client ticks clock locally between polls | Patch live list on fp change; **goal glow** on score increase; **score digit glow** (0–0 white bloom) on new live game row only; **`live_clocks` every heartbeat** for SRL-9 (pending / running + stale budget) |
| `online_fp` | Ordered online player ids (login-first sort) | Patch Online list + heading count (**count: no glow**); **name glow** when row `data-last-login-epoch` increased vs session memory (just logged in; both same-second logins glow) |
| `last_login_epoch` | Head of `playertable.LastLogin` | Refresh recent logins — **no glow** |
| `last_join_epoch` | Head of `playertable.JoinDate` | Refresh new players — **no glow** |
| Local 1 s timer | Client math on last live payload | Tick when **running**; freeze when **pending** or **held** (SRL-9) |

### Rated finish cascade (rare, coordinated refresh)

When **`last_rated_id`** (or confirming **`games_played`**) changes:

| Section | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Live games | Patch (finished game should drop off) |
| Recent games | Full list refresh; **player names + score digits glow** for each **new game id** |
| Rating table + heading count | **Full tbody reload**; **glow** each **rating gainer** on the finishing game (`AdjustmentA/B > 0`) — **Elo only** when row present |
| League Activity + Points | Full reload for **active tab** period key; **Activity Games** white bloom for both finishers; **Points Pts** white bloom for winner (both on draw) |
| League meta | Refresh `total_games`, period label |
| **Games this day / week** | When active tab is **Daily** or **Weekly** (and pulse key matches the viewed key): refresh that games block — day list JSON → client HTML; week HTML from `k2_status_week_games_html` |
| Arc ticker | Refresh game count — **no glow** |

**No cascade-only glow pass** — finished-game panels do not get an extra choreographed glow sequence (SRL-12 retired).

**Do not cascade-refresh:** Online (unless `online_fp` also changed), New players (unless join signal), heritage box, arc “since DATE” label, arc player count (changes rarely — optional daily refresh on period key change).

---

## Heartbeat signal bundle

Computed **fresh on each poll** (minimal SQL — **not** a full `k2_status_load_room()`). No cross-request signal cache; stale cached bundles must not suppress updates after a rated finish or lobby change.

| Signal | SQL sketch | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| `last_rated_id` | `SELECT MAX(id) FROM ratedresults` | Cascade trigger |
| `games_played` | `SELECT GamesPlayed FROM generalstatstable WHERE id = 1` | Arc confirm |
| `live_fp` | Live rows from `resulttable` (started, not finished, not shelved) | Same filter as `k2_status_live_games()` |
| `online_fp` | `playertable` where `IsOnline <> 0` | Lobby presence |
| `last_login_epoch` | `MAX(LastLogin)` or head row timestamp | |
| `last_join_epoch` | `MAX(JoinDate)` or head row timestamp | |
| `league_fp` | `{ period, key, total_games }` for active period | From `player_period_league` when present |
| `period_keys` | Current day/week/month/year keys (UTC) | Rollover detection |
| `server_now_epoch` | MySQL `NOW()` or PHP clock | Client countdown + meta |
| `revision` | Hash of all signals | Short-circuit unchanged responses |

When `changed: true`, include **`sections`** object with payloads only for signals that flipped (or full cascade bundle on `last_rated_id` change).

## Live games — display contract

Per game in JSON:

```json
{
  "game_id": 12345,
  "id_a": 1, "name_a": "…",
  "id_b": 2, "name_b": "…",
  "score_a": 2, "score_b": 1,
  "period": 1,
  "half_countdown": 14250,
  "start": "2026-07-05 22:14:00"
}
```

| Field | UI |
|-------|-----|
| `start` | Existing day clock markup |
| scores | Existing score HTML; pulse on change |
| `period` | `1st half` / `2nd half` |
| `half_countdown` | **Client-ticked** `M:SS` in `.k2-status-live-list__clock` |

**Half countdown math (locked):** 50 ticks per second ([`k2_status_format_half_countdown()`](../../site/public_html/includes/status_queries.php)). Full half = **15000** ticks (`5:00`). Prod `HalfCountdown` often updates about every **~3 wall seconds**.

Pulse always includes `live_clocks`. Client per-game phases (`status-room-live.js`):

| Phase | When | Display |
|-------|------|---------|
| **pending** | New game / new half at full time (`≥ 15000`), or `half ≤ 0` (`—`) | Frozen at server sample — **no** client tick |
| **running** | First **decrease** of `HalfCountdown` in the same period, or first sample already mid-half (`0 < half < 15000`) | Smooth 1 s interpolation from last anchor |
| **held** | No decrease for **`PAUSE_DETECT_SEC = 6`** while running (pause / stalled writes) | Frozen until the next decrease |

**Running tick:**

`remaining_ticks = half_countdown - (client_now - sync_epoch) * 50`

- **`sync_epoch` uses the client clock** (`Date.now()`), never pulse `server_now_epoch` — avoids freeze/stutter when server time is ahead of the browser.
- **No per-tick stale cap** — capping at ~4 s caused pause-between-seconds stutter when writes were irregular. Pause is **held** after 6 s without a decrease instead.
- Clamp at 0 → display `—`.

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Sample unchanged | Keep prior anchor; after 6 s running → **held** |
| `HalfCountdown` decreases and server ≤ local prediction | Keep local (sparse write behind the tick) |
| `HalfCountdown` decreases and server ≥ local | → **running**, re-anchor on client now |
| Period change or countdown reset upward to full half | → **pending** until next decrease |
| Mid-match page load (`half` already below full) | → **running** immediately |

**Goals (SRL-9):**

1. **Do not start** before the server clock actually moves (hold at `5:00` while row exists but countdown still full).
2. **Do not run ahead** when the server clock stops — after 6 s with no decrease → **held** (allows smooth tick across the normal ~3 s write gap).
3. **Injury time (later):** no Status-wired pause/injury field today (`HalfCountdown` + `GamePeriod` only). Probe candidates later: `GameEventJSON` / `FrameDataJSON`, or `half = 0` while still live — not implemented.

**Diff rules:**

- Same `game_id`, score/period changed → update scores in place (no list HTML replace); on goal: **glow scoring cell → reveal new digit at ~2 s** (SRL-11); resync clock anchor from payload
- New `game_id` → list replace; **kickoff score digit glow** on new live row(s).
- Missing `game_id` → remove row (no glow)
- **Empty list** → “No live games in progress.” plus **This week's league standings →** (SSR + `applyLiveEmpty` in `status-room-live.js`; href from `data-week-league-href` on the Live panel → `#k2-status-leagues-title` with current week lens)

**List patch glow:** **`recent_games`** (new game id → both player names). **Online** glow via **`LastLogin` epoch** after patch (not DOM-id diff). Live kickoff glow in `patchLive`.

---

## Glow contract

**Glow events:**

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Player enters Online panel | **Name** — warm bloom when **`LastLogin` advanced** |
| New live game row | **Score digits** — white bloom (0–0 kickoff) |
| New recent game row | **Names** warm + **score digits** white |
| Goal scored (live) | **Scoring cell** — white bloom on old digit, **new count at ~2 s** (SRL-11) |
| Rated finish — rating gainer in active LB | **Elo link** — warm bloom |
| Rated finish — league Activity | **Games** cell — warm bloom |
| Rated finish — league Points | **Pts** cell — warm bloom |

**Palettes:** **Warm bloom** (`k2-live-glow-bloom-warm`) — player names, Elo, league cascade cells. **White bloom** — `.blue` stat digits + live/recent **score** digits. Default accent bloom elsewhere unchanged.

**No glow:** recent logins, new players, online count, arc counts, league meta, non-gainer LB rows, league rows not in the finishing game.

## API response shape (sketch)

**Unchanged:**

```json
{
  "changed": false,
  "revision": "a1b2c3",
  "server_now_epoch": 1751756400,
  "live_clocks": [
    { "game_id": 990001, "half_countdown": 14250, "period": 1 }
  ]
}
```

**Changed (partial or cascade):** same top-level fields plus `signals`, optional `sections`; **`live_clocks` always present**.

```json
{
  "changed": true,
  "revision": "d4e5f6",
  "server_now_epoch": 1751756401,
  "signals": { "last_rated_id": 75684, "live_fp": "…", … },
  "cascade": true,
  "sections": {
    "live": [ … ],
    "online": [ … ],
    "recent_games": { "html": "…" },
    "ratings": {
      "count": 68,
      "tbody_html": "…"
    },
    "league": { "activity": …, "points": …, "meta": … },
    "arc": { "players": 264, "games": 75684, "since_label": "…" }
  }
}
```

Client sends optional `?revision=` to allow 304-style short responses.

## Integration with existing Leagues JS

[`status-period-competitions.js`](../site/public_html/js/status-period-competitions.js) today runs a **30 s** `refreshMeta` interval for countdown text only.

**When live room ships:** pulse heartbeat owns league meta **`total_games`** and period rollover; **retire or gate** the 30 s meta interval to avoid duplicate work. Countdown “time left” may remain client-side from embedded `data-league-end-epoch` (same as today).

**Tab visibility:** client keeps 1 s poll while loaded (SRL-2); browsers may throttle background tabs — **`catchUpOnVisible`** in `status-room-live.js` (`visibilitychange` / `pageshow` / `focus`) polls immediately when Status returns to foreground.

---

## Environment notes

| Environment | Behaviour |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Production** | Heartbeat reads live DB; room feels truly live. **No sim harness** (guard blocks). |
| **Staging (`kooldb1`)** | Heartbeat works; data is import snapshot. Synced sim **code** is inert — wrong host + DB. |
| **Local dev (`ratingskickoff.test` → `ko2unity_db`)** | Snapshot stale; sim **disabled**. |
| **Local work (`work.ratingskickoff.test` → `ko2unity_work`)** | **Live environment sim** — harness + pulse-driven ticks. Primary test bed for v1.5. |

No Steve agreement required to **build** or **test on work**; prod read authority unchanged from [`STATUS_PAGE_DATA.md`](STATUS_PAGE_DATA.md).

---

## Production readiness (pulse vs sim)

**Audited Jul 2026 (updated post-SRL-9).** Status live **code is deploy-safe to prod** — read-only polling, sim hook guarded no-op off work. **End-to-end “live lobby on game night”** still depends on prod game-server write cadence (`HalfCountdown`, `IsOnline`, rated finish rows) — confirm with Steve before calling behaviour proven.

### Deploy-safe vs behaviour-proven

| Lens | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| **Sync PHP/JS to prod** | **Yes** — sim never runs outside `ko2unity_work` + `work.ratingskickoff.test` |
| **Pulse reads only** | **Yes** — no sim JSON; no signal cache on read path |
| **Clock accuracy on prod** | **Client state machine** — pending → running (smooth, client `sync_epoch`) → held after 6 s without decrease; injury not wired |
| **Validated on prod-like traffic** | **Work sim + staging snapshot only** — soak on real server recommended |

### What prod pulse does (every request)

| Step | Source | Sim-dependent? |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Optional pre-hook | `k2_status_room_sim_tick_if_due()` | **Only when** `k2_status_room_sim_is_allowed()` — requires **`ko2unity_work`** + host **`work.ratingskickoff.test`**. On prod/staging: **never runs**. |
| Signal bundle | `k2_status_pulse_collect_signals()` — `ratedresults`, `generalstatstable`, `resulttable`, `playertable`, league totals | **No** — fresh SQL each call (no `status_room_pulse_cache` on read path) |
| Section HTML | `k2_status_pulse_build_sections()` — same query helpers as SSR (`status_queries.php`) | **No** |
| Client patch | `status-room-live.js` + `k2-live-glow.js` | **No** — no sim/host/DB branches |

### Sim is a work-only **writer**, not a pulse **reader**

- Sim state lives in temp JSON (`k2_status_room_live_sim_*.json`); pulse **never reads** it.
- Sim ticks (when allowed) **write ground truth** (`playertable`, `resulttable`, `ratedresults` via ops) — same shape as prod game-server writes. Pulse then observes those rows like any other writer.
- `status_room_pulse_cache.php` is **sim-side invalidation only** (legacy helper); pulse API does **not** cache signals.

### Synced code on prod

- `api/status_room_pulse.php` **includes** `status_room_live_sim.php` but the tick hook is a **guarded no-op** outside work — safe to deploy with WinSCP.
- **Prod requirement:** live game-server (or ops) continues writing `resulttable` / `playertable` / `ratedresults`; pulse only **reads**.

### Client contract (prod-safe)

- Poll `GET /api/status_room_pulse.php` with previous `signals` query params; apply `sections` patches when `changed: true`.
- **`live_clocks`** on **every** response — client applies SRL-9 state machine (pending / running / held).
- No sim URLs or host branches in client JS.
