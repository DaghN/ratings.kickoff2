# Player Opponents — Head-to-head poster & pair detail

**Status:** Poster + pair-detail race tables + **moments grid** + **matchup charts** shipped (Jun 2026).  
**Authority:** Dagh’s latest message → this doc → [`player-opponents-hub.md`](player-opponents-hub.md) → [`design-direction.md`](design-direction.md).

**Related:** [`player-profile-feast.md`](player-profile-feast.md) (hero / surface rhythm) · [`website-data-contract.md`](website-data-contract.md) (`player_matchup_summary` SCH-008 / SCH-019).

## Page job (H2H tab)

When a pair is selected, the Head-to-head tab tells the **rivalry story** in layers:

| Layer | Job | Status |
|-------|-----|--------|
| **Pickers** | Choose opponent (search · by games · A–Z) | Shipped v1 |
| **Poster** | Pair identity + headline record — “fight card” summary | **Shipped locally (Jun 2026)** |
| **Pair detail** | Symmetric player-vs-player stat races (Results · Goals · DDs) for *this opponent only* | **Shipped Jun 2026** |
| **Charts** | Top opponents bar (context), cumulative H2H, rating comparison | **Shipped Jun 2026** (moved from Profile) |
| **Moments** | Fixed 3×3 pair trophy grid (nine slots, dim until active; duplicates allowed) | **Shipped Jun 2026** |
| **Games link** | Optional deep link to Games tab filtered by opponent | Optional |

**Profile rhyme:** Profile opens with a **single-player hero** + curated bands. H2H opens with a **pair poster** + pair-specific analyst depth. The wing hero at page top stays **subject-only**; the poster is the relational introduction.

## Poster contract (v1)

### Purpose

Replace the plain `Gianni vs Fabio` headline with a **versus poster**: two players in opposition, record unmistakable at a glance. Size the panel to fit its information well — neither cramped nor wastefully tall. No country (online). No first/last game dates in v1.

### In scope

| Element | Both players | Notes |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Avatar** | Yes | Reuse `k2-player-hero__avatar` idiom (initial + accent ring) |
| **Name** | Yes | Link to player profile (locked policy) |
| **Rank** | Yes | Ladder rank when `Display = 1`; else em dash |
| **Rating** | Yes | Current rating when displayed |
| **Country / flag** | **No** | Online only — omit entirely |
| **Centre record** | W · D · L | **Hero stat** of the poster — large, clear, colour-coded |

### Out of scope (poster v1)

- First / last game date or score
- Country or flags
- DD/CS, max/min goals, ratios (→ **pair detail** below)
- Charts (separate panels below poster)
- Duplicate full wing-hero strip for subject (page hero already shows subject)

### W/D/L presentation (required)

- Three **large tabular numbers** with labels **W · D · L**
- Colour: reuse games-table semantics — **wins blue**, **losses red**, **draws muted/neutral** (see `theme.css` `.blue` / `.red` on player games)
- Colour on **numbers** or chips — not full neon panels
- Must read correctly for colour-blind users: labels always visible, not colour-only

### Layout principles

- **Height:** **Appropriately sized** for the content — let typography and spacing breathe; avoid cramming and avoid empty padding for its own sake. Not a fixed “must be short” rule; judge by feel on a real pair with a typical name length.
- **Composition:** Split card — player left · centre record · player right; subtle “home corner” for subject (left) optional
- **Surface:** Bare stage background — cards, counts and meter float with no outer panel border (card glow can spill). Prompt/empty states keep a small bordered plate.
- **Mobile:** Stack or scale; centre record stays legible
- **Empty states:** No pair selected → prompt (current). Pair with 0 games → both players visible, centre “No rated games”

### Data (read path)

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Subject / opponent identity, rating, rank, display | `playertable` + existing hero rank logic |
| W/D/L, goals, games | `player_matchup_summary` directed row `player_id` → `opponent_id` (live fallback if table missing) |

No new schema for poster v1.

### Implementation (as built — Jun 2026)

- Render: `k2_h2h_poster_card_html()` + `player_opponents_render_h2h_poster()` in `includes/player_opponents_h2h.php`; called from `player_opponents_render_h2h_panel()` inside `k2-player-opponents-h2h__stage`.
- CSS: `stylesheets/player-opponents-h2h-poster.css` (namespace `k2-h2h2-*`); linked from `player/opponents/h2h.php`.
- Composition:
  - **Mirrored identity cards** — avatar · name · rank · rating in glowing hero-style cards; opponent card mirrored so avatars face the `vs` and **rank sits on the outer (avatar) edge, rating toward centre** on both sides. Whole card links to player profile (garden-style hover lift).
  - **W/D/L hero** — subject **Wins** (blue) · **Draws** (centre) · opponent **Wins** (red, same count as subject losses); each side reads from that fighter’s perspective. Win counts: **full neon stack**, display weight **600**.
  - **Lead meter** — proportional blue / muted / red bar under the counts; **chrome + red segments** get neon box-shadow bloom (draw stays flat).
  - **All games link** — chrome filled pill below pair-detail races, above moments deck: `All {N} rated games vs {opponent} →` → `/player/games.php?id=&opponent=`; same 14%/42% chrome fill recipe as tier pills (~11–13px).
  - **Goals removed from poster** — totals and goal depth live in pair-detail race tables only.
  - **0 games** — both cards visible; “No rated games yet” below.
- Reuses `k2_route('player-profile')`, `k2_h()`, `k2_fmt_int()`, `k2_db_is_null()`, and the same rank query idiom as the hero.
- W/D/L colours: subject **chrome-locked** (`--k2-pure-chrome` via `.k2-player-opponents-h2h`); opponent `--k2-table-negative` (`.red`). Wing hero above keeps picked tint — rivalry band only.

## Pair moments grid (shipped Jun 2026; scorecard redesign)

Fixed **3×3 deck** of **scorecard cards** below the race table. All nine slots always visible; inactive slots are dim ghosts. Active cards show: **kicker** (moment type) · **true scoreline** · **date** (whole card links to the game). **Double presence allowed** — same game may fill several cells.

### Slot order (kickers)

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| First game | Latest game | Goal feast |
| {Subject}'s best haul | {Opponent}'s best haul | Highest draw |
| {Subject}'s biggest win | {Opponent}'s biggest win | Tightest game |

### Score identity (locked)

- **Never flip a score.** The scoreline is the stored `NameA GoalsA – GoalsB NameB`; a 0–17 stays 0–17 with the correct names. Names shown in **full**, both sides.
- **Rivalry colours on the scoreline only.** Card shells stay neutral (subtle border, no outcome glow). Winner **name** (own chrome/red) + **goals** use rivalry ink with neon on the winning digit; beaten **name + goals** are heavily dimmed grey. **Dash** and **date** stay muted on decided games. **Draw:** both **names + goals** holo (`--k2-pure-holo`) with neon on goals; **kicker**, **dash**, and **date** muted draw scale.

### Activation

| Slot | Active when |
|------|-------------|
| First / latest / goal feast / tightest / best haul ×2 | ≥1 rated game in pair |
| Highest draw | ≥1 draw |
| {Subject}'s biggest win | Subject has ≥1 win vs opponent |
| {Opponent}'s biggest win | Opponent has ≥1 win vs subject |

Ties on the same extreme → **first chronological** game (`Date ASC`, `id ASC`).

### Data

Read-time: one indexed `ratedresults` pair scan — `player_opponents_h2h_pair_games_rows()` in `includes/player_opponents_h2h_moments.php`. Keeps true A/B orientation; subject-relative metrics only pick which game fills each slot. Stored `*_game_id` per slot later (no schema in v1).

### Implementation

- Load + render: `player_opponents_h2h_moments.php`; CSS `player-opponents-h2h-moments.css` (self-contained `k2-h2h2-mcard` scorecards — no `player-feast.css` / emoji).
- **Scoreline names** — 3-column board (`1fr auto 1fr`); each side stretches full column width; names centre-aligned, `overflow-wrap: break-word` only when genuinely needed (no `text-wrap: pretty` / `anywhere`). Long names (~14 chars) fit one line in the 48rem deck via slight negative letter-spacing.
- **Scoreline accent** (Jun 2026 v2): subject-win / opponent-win / draw **goals** use full poster race-leader neon `text-shadow` (five layers); lit **names** 82% tint mix, no shadow. Card frame neutral; kickers `--k2-mc-draw`.

## Pair detail — stat races (shipped Jun 2026)

Below the poster, a **single centred race table** (no band headers, no name repeat, no games line). Subject blue left · label centre · opponent red right. Leader tint only — no mini bars.

### Rows (v1 slim)

Goals scored · Goals per game · Most scored · Biggest winning margin · Least conceded (lower wins) · Double digits · Clean sheets · Performance rating

**Performance rating** — chess-style TPR per player in this pairing only: each side’s score vs the other’s **pre-game rating** in every rated game (`ratedresults`). Read-time (`player_h2h_pair_performance_ratings()` + shared `performance_rating.php`); min 2 games; **∞** on perfect **win** only (all wins); narrow dash (`-`) on perfect loss. Tooltip on row label.

**Deferred:** wins/draws (on poster), goal ratio, highest/lowest-scoring game, highest-scoring draw, DD/CS rates — moments or later slices.

### Framing

- **Symmetric positives** — e.g. your goals scored vs their goals scored (`goals_for` vs `goals_against` on the directed row). Conceded columns are the opponent’s positive stat.
- **Leader tint** — winning value wrapped in `.blue` (subject) or `.red` (opponent); **ties** — both values in their own colour (chrome left, red right) except **0–0** (muted default grey) on every row except **Least conceded**, where 0–0 still tints both sides. Leader/tie numerals use **neon text-shadow** (shared with poster W/L counts).

### Data

Single directed row from `player_matchup_summary` (SCH-019 when present). Live single-pair aggregation fallback when summary or extension columns missing — `player_opponents_h2h_pair_detail_load()` in `includes/player_opponents_h2h.php`. **Performance rating** is always attached read-time from `ratedresults` (`player_h2h_performance_rating.php`), not stored on the summary row.

### Implementation

- Render: `player_opponents_render_h2h_pair_detail()` — called from `player_opponents_render_h2h_panel()` after poster when `games &gt; 0`.
- CSS: `stylesheets/player-opponents-h2h-poster.css` (namespace `k2-h2h2-detail`, `k2-h2h2-race`).

## Pair detail band (archive note)

Earlier plan was three wide analyst bands mirroring sub-tab columns. **Superseded** by symmetric race tables above (Jun 2026).

### W/D/L row fields (from `player_opponents_tables.php`) — reference only

Games · Wins · Draws · Losses · Win Ratio · Draw Ratio · Loss Ratio

### Goals row fields — reference only

Games · GF · GA · GF/g · GA/g · Ratio · Max GF · Max GA · Max win · Max loss · Max sum · Draw · Min GF · Min GA · Min sum

### DDs row fields — reference only

Games · Double Digits · Clean Sheets · DD Ratio · CS Ratio · DD conceded · CS conceded · DD C Ratio · CS C Ratio

### Data

Single directed row from `player_matchup_summary` (SCH-019 columns when present). Ratios computed at read time — same as table renderers.

### UX direction (TBD — superseded)

- Not one wide 30-column table
- Likely **three grouped bands** (W/D/L · Goals · DDs) mirroring sub-tab semantics
- Lives **below poster**, above charts

## Scroll order (target)

1. Wing hero (subject) — existing page chrome  
2. Opponents sub-nav  
3. H2H pickers  
4. **Poster**  
5. **Pair detail** (stat races)  
6. **Moments** (3×3 grid)  
7. **Matchup charts** — cumulative H2H · rating comparison · goals per game (`player_opponents_h2h_charts.php`; initial opponent from URL `data-chart-opponent-id`)

**Profile:** most-played opponents bar only (`player_feast_render_top_opponents_chart`); bar click → H2H tab with `?opponent=`.

### Charts (shipped Jun 2026)

Pair charts render below moments when the subject has played opponents. **Top opponents bar** is on **Profile** only (Jun 2026 restore).

| Chart | Where | Behaviour |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Top opponents** | Profile | Horizontal bar; click → Opponents H2H `?opponent=` (carry-scroll) |
| **Head-to-head** | H2H tab | Cumulative wins vs selected opponent |
| **Cumulative goals** | H2H tab | Cumulative goals scored per side by game #; meta shows final totals |
| **Rating comparison** | H2H tab | Full career paths; date / games-played toggle |
| **Goals per game** | H2H tab | Your histogram (chrome) + rival histogram (red) + **Side by side** grouped chart; shared 0..max x-axis; clicks → `games.php?gf=` / `?ga=` + `opponent=` |
| **Combined goals per game** | H2H tab | `SumOfGoals` histogram (holo); below side-by-side; meta = “Across {n} rated games, {A} and {B} average {avg} combined goals per game.”; bar click → `games.php?gs=` + `opponent=` |
| **Scoreline heatmap** | H2H tab | **Rectangular** GF×GA grid (hero rows 0…max GF, rival cols 0…max GA in the pairing); **36px** tiles; hero vertical (**0 at bottom**, label left) × rival horizontal (**0 at left**, ticks + name **below** grid); origin **0–0 bottom-left**; up to 8 intensity levels (fewer when peak count is low); intensity scale with `{hero} win` / `{rival} win` row labels; horizontal scroll when wider than panel; click → `games.php?gf=&ga=&opponent=` |

**Chart ink (Jun 2026):** H2H pair charts use `K2ChartTheme.h2hSubject*` (chart chrome = `--k2-chart-chrome` / pure chrome) and `h2hOpponent*` (`--k2-table-negative` red — same as poster `.red`, **not** `--k2-chart-magenta`). Profile top-opponents bar still uses pitch/chrome `profileCompare` / `opponentFocus`. H2H goals: **two single-series histograms** (chrome you, red rival) **plus** optional grouped comparison chart; **combined goals per game** uses holo (`--k2-chart-holo`) as a match-level stat; **scoreline heatmap** uses same outcome colours on a DOM grid (not Chart.js); Profile goals-per-game histogram uses **chrome** single series (same ink as H2H subject). Rating compare **By date / By games** toggle active state: `--k2-pure-chrome` + `--k2-h2h2-chrome-ring` (not tint `--k2-segment-active-*`). **Amiga By date / By tournament #:** **Stepwise / Connected** toolbar toggle (default **Stepwise**) on both views; flat tail to today at `currentRating` for inactive careers on **By date**. **By date** tooltips use shared `K2ChartDateRange.resolveCompare*DateTooltipItems` — one row per player at cursor date; **By tournament #** uses `resolveCompareRatingGameTooltipItems` at shared tournament index. Hover dots + tooltip anchor on **higher-rated** player (custom `afterDraw` at cursor X × line Y). **By tournament #** tooltip title = shared index only (`Tournament #N`); each series label carries that player’s tournament name + date + **bold chrome/red rating** (HTML tooltip — `pm3-chart-tooltip-rating--subject` / `--opponent`). Same ink on **By date** rating compare tooltips. **Rank comparison** tooltips use the same HTML pattern — date title, player name + **bold chrome/red `#rank`** only (` of L (P%)` in body ink); no tournament names. Same shared date resolver as rating **By date** (`chart-date-range.js`).

Initial opponent comes from URL / default top opponent (`data-chart-opponent-id` on `.k2-player-opponents-h2h`). No duplicate “compare someone else” search — page pickers cover that.

Scripts: Chart.js + `player-head-to-head-chart.js`, `player-head-to-head-goals-chart.js`, `player-h2h-total-goals-histogram.js`, `player-h2h-scoreline-heatmap.js`, `player-compare-rating-chart.js`, `player-goals-scored-histogram.js` (H2H view in `player_opponents_page.php`). Profile loads `player-top-opponents-chart.js` and `player-goals-scored-histogram.js` separately.

Profile keeps **Career rating** + **Games per month** only.  
7. Optional games link
